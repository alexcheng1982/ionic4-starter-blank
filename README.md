# Ionic 4 Starter - Blank

Ionic 4 is still under development. This project provides a starting point for trying Ionic 4.


Included in this project:

* `@ionic/core` - `0.1.4`
* `@ionic/angular` - `0.1.4`
* Angular - `5.2.9`
* Unit tests with Jasmine & Karma
* End-to-end tests with Protractor


To start local development server, run `npm run serve`.

Ionic CLI has limited support for Ionic 4, so Angular CLI and Cordova CLI should be used instead.


To emulate on Android, run `npm run emulate:android`.
